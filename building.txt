= Introduction =

This document describes how to build e, including its dependencies.

To build e you will need:

* A copy of Visual C++ 2008
** You can get the free express edition at http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/
** Full Visual Studio versions also work fine.
** Note that opening a 2008 .sln file created with the Express version may still
   prompt you to "upgrade" the .sln if you open it with a full Visual Studio SKU.

* A set of GNU tools for Windows (including bash, patch, wget, etc.)
** Cygwin and Msys both support these tools.
** You'll probably end up with both anyway, Cygwin for e support and Msys for git support.

To build e you will need a copy of Visual C++ 2008.
* Any version of Visual Studio 2008 will also work, of course.
* Note that opening a 2008 .sln file created with the Express version may still
  prompt you to upgrade the .sln if you open it with a full Visual Studio SKU.

= Building the Dependencies =

e's code dependencies are:
* wxWidgets
* Metakit
* PCRE
* libcurl
* libtommath
* libtomcrypt
* TinyXML


To download, patch and compile these dependencies:
* Run "get_externals_win.sh" in a cygwin shell.
* Run "build_externals_win.cmd" in a VS2008 Command Prompt.

Later versions of these projects may work with e, but have not been tested.
Consult the "get_externals_win.sh" script to see what the expected version of a dependency is.


= Building e Itself =
* After building all the dependencies, open "e.sln" and build the Debug target.
* Note that the resulting e.exe in "Debug" has no idea where Themes/Bundles/Support/etc. are.
* If you want to run the new "e.exe", you'll need to provide it with the support files.
** One way to do this is to copy over the support folders from your licensed copy in "C:\Program Files\e".
