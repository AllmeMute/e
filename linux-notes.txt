Before building:

- libtomcrypt patch should NOT be applied
- src/stdint.h needs to be moved or deleted
    
Ubuntu packages required before building:

- libwxgtk2.8-dev
- libglib2.0-dev
- libatk1.0-dev

These files do not compile, probably due to Windows dependencies:

- CygwinDlg.cpp - not needed, all uses are commented out
- ExceptionHandler.cpp - never used?
- ExceptionAttacher.cpp - never used?
- GetWinVer.cpp - only used by ExceptionHandler
- IEHtmlWin.cpp - cannot be compiled, replaced by MozillaHtmlWnd? all use is commented out
- MiniVersion.cpp - only used by ExceptionHandler
- ShellContextMenu.cpp - cannot be compiled, should be replaced with Gnome/KDE equivalent
- wxactivex.cpp - only used by IEHtmlWin, cannot be compiled

These files do not compile for other reasons:

- MozillaHtmlWnd.cpp - incomplete?
