To build you will need to:
* Have Visual Studio 2008 C++
* Download and install wxWidgets, version 2.8.x
* Get and build everything listed in the "external" folder.

= wxWidgets =
* Download the installer for wxWidgets 2.8.10 (wxMSW)
** http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/
* Run the installer.
* We'll assume the standard install location of "C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\"
* Reference C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\docs\msw\install.txt for wxWidgets build instructions.
* If you build with Visual Studio GUI:
** When you open build\msw\wx.dsw, you'll be prompted to upgrade to a .sln; do this.
** Compile the appropriate library version for the version of "e" you're working:
** For Debug versions of "e": Win32 Unicode Debug  (NOT the .DLL version)
* Create a system environmental variable named "WXWIN28" set to "C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\"  (without quotes)
** Make sure it's a system variable, and not a personal one.
