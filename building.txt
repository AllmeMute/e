To build you will need to:
* Have Visual Studio 2008 C++
* Download and install wxWidgets, version 2.8.x
* Get and build everything listed in the "external" folder.

= wxWidgets =
wxWidgets is a cross-platform GUI toolkit.

Website: http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

== Installation ==
* Download the installer for wxWidgets 2.8.10 (wxMSW)
* Run the installer.
* We'll assume the standard install location of "C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\"

== Patching ==
TODO: Notes on using the supplied patches.

== Building ==
* Reference C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\docs\msw\install.txt for wxWidgets build instructions.
* If you build with Visual Studio GUI:
** When you open build\msw\wx.dsw, you'll be prompted to upgrade to a .sln; do this.
** Compile the appropriate library version for the version of "e" you're working:
** For Debug versions of "e": Win32 Unicode Debug  (NOT the .DLL version)

== Configuration ==
* Create a system environmental variable named "WXWIN28" set to "C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\"  (without quotes)
** Make sure it's a system variable, and not a personal one.


= Metakit =
Metakit is a lightweight embedded database.

Website: http://www.equi4.com/metakit/overview.html

== Installation ==
* The easiest way to get Metakit sources is to use Subversion.
* In e/external:
* svn export svn://www.equi4.com/metakit/trunk metakit

== Building ==
* Open "metakit\win\msvc60\mksrc.sln" and allow the .sln to be upgraded for VS2008.
* Change the configuration to "Debug" (not Debug MFC or Debug STD, just plain "Debug")
* The Python and Tcl bindings for Metakit will fail to build (unless you set them up);
  that's OK as e doesn't use them.


= PCRE =
PRCE is a library for Perl-compatible regular expressions.
e is currently using version 7.6.

Website: http://pcre.org/

== Installation ==
* Get the 7.6 source package from either:
** http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10194&package_id=9960&release_id=572108
** ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/
* Unzip / decompress the download so you end up with external/pcre-7.6

== Building ==
* PCRE doesn't have a Visual Studio .sln, you'll need to use the command line.
* TO-DO ???

= cURL =
cURL is a library for retreiving files from URLs.

Website: http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
Download Archive: http://curl.haxx.se/download/

== Installation ==
* Download the source archive for version 7.18.23
* Unzip / decompress the download so you end up with external/libcurl-7.18.2

== Building ==
* Review the build instructions in: external\curl-7.18.2\packages\Win32\README
* TO-DO ???


= libtommath =
"LibTomMath provides highly optimized and portable routines for a vast majority of integer based number theoretic applications (including public key cryptography)."
LibTomMath is a dependency of LibTomCrypt, not e directly.

== Installation ==
* Download 0.4.1 from: http://www.atarininja.org/~wxs/distfiles/ltm-0.41.tar.bz2
* Decompress the archive.
* Rename the folder "libtommath-0.41" to just "libtommath"
* Move the folder so you end up with externa/libtommath

== Building ==
* Open "libtommath.dsp" as a solution/project.
* Allow Visual Studio to upgrade the project.
* If prompted, remove source control bindings.
* Build the solution, Debug version.
* (Save the .SLN file if prompted.)


= libtomcrypt =
"LibTomCrypt is a public domain open source cryptographic toolkit written in portable C."

Website: http://libtomcrypt.com/download.html
Mirror of version 1.17: http://www.atarininja.org/~wxs/distfiles/crypt-1.17.tar.bz2

== Installation ==
* Download version 1.17
* Unzip / decompress the download so you end up with external/libtomcrypt-1.17

== Building ==
* Open "libtomcrypt.dsp" as a solution/project.
* Allow Visual Studio to upgrade the project.
* If prompted, remove source control bindings.
* Build the solution, Debug version.
* (Save the .SLN file if prompted.)


= TinyMXL =
"TinyXML is a simple, small, C++ XML parser that can be easily integrating into other programs."

Website: http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/

= Installation =
* Download the source archive from SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyxml
* Unzip / decompress the download so you end up with external/tinyxml

= Building =
* Open "tinyxml.sln" with Visual Studio 2008.
* Allow Visual Studio to upgrade the project.
* Build the solution, Debug version.
