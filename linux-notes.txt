Before building:

- libtomcrypt patch should NOT be applied
- src/stdint.h needs to be moved or deleted
    
Ubuntu packages required before building:

- libwxgtk2.8-dev
- libglib2.0-dev
- libatk1.0-dev

These files do not compile, probably due to Windows dependencies:

- CygwinDlg.cpp
- ExceptionHandler.cpp
- ExceptionAttacher.cpp
- GetWinVer.cpp
- IEHtmlWin.cpp
- MiniVersion.cpp
- ShellContextMenu.cpp
- wxactivex.cpp

These files do not compile for other reasons:

- styler-users.cpp
- MozillaHtmlWnd.cpp
- Utf.cpp
