To build you will need to:
* Have Visual Studio 2008 C++
* Get and build everything listed in the "external" folder.
* Download and install wxWidgets, version 2.8.x
** Download and run the installer for wxWidgets.
** We'll assume the standard install location for 2.8.10.
** See C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\docs\msw\install.txt for wxWidgets build instructions.
** When you open build\msw\wx.dsw, you'll be prompted to upgrade to a .sln; do this.
** Compile the appropriate library version for the version of "e" you're working:
*** Win32 Debug for Debug versions of "e".
