== Language Editor crashes ==

Reporter: adamv

* Open a text file (any)
* Open the bundle editor
* Open a language syntax
* Close all tabs, so there's only a new "untitled" tab showing
* Reopen a language syntax

At this point an assertion fails trying to retreive syntax information.
(todo - add stack trace & line number)

I can reproduce this consistently on Windows XP SP 3.
