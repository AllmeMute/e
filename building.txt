= Building e =

This document describes how to build e, including its dependencies.

To build e you will need a copy of Visual C++ 2008.
* You can get the free express edition at http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/
* Any version of Visual Studio 2008 will also work, of course.
* Note that opening a 2008 .sln file created with the Express version may still
  prompt you to "upgrade" the .sln if you open it with a full Visual Studio SKU.

To apply patches to dependencies you will need a patch tool.
* One is available in msys (a set of Unix tools for Windows.)


The following dependencies are required:
* wxWidgets (2.8.7)
* Metakit
* PCRE (7.6)
* libcurl (7.19.4)
* libtommath (0.4.1)
* libtomcrypt (1.17)
* TinyXML

Many of the dependencies below can be retrieved all-at-once from git at:
http://github.com/adamv/e-externals/tree/master

Later versions of these projects may work with e, but have not been tested.
To use a later version of a dependency, the appropriate include and lib paths
must be altered in the e project.



Note that many of these dependencies do not compile quite "out of the box" 
on Visual Studio 2008. Where they do include project files for Visual Studio,
they are usually for older versions. These project files will typically 
upgrade when you open them, and build OK but with caveats noted below.

If you plan to build using upgraded projects, then you should make sure to copy
any outputs of those builds to the places that e.sln expects them to be.

The other, easier alternative is to use the VS2008 projects provided in
"external/build_msvc".


= wxWidgets =
wxWidgets is a cross-platform GUI toolkit.

Website: http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/
Installer for 2.8.7: http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=9863&use_mirror=softlayer&filename=wxMSW-2.8.7-Setup.exe&a=8859437

== Installation ==
* Download the installer for wxWidgets 2.8.7 (wxMSW)
* Run the installer.
* We'll assume the standard install location of "C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7\"

== Patching ==
If you installed version 2.8.7 in the default location, you can apply the patches as follows.
Open a terminal to: external/patches/widgets
Run:
* patch -p0 < auibook.h.patch
* patch -p0 < auibook.cpp.patch

== Building ==
* Reference C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7\docs\msw\install.txt for wxWidgets build instructions.
* If you build with Visual Studio GUI:
** When you open build\msw\wx.dsw, you'll be prompted to upgrade to a .sln; do this.
** Compile the appropriate library version for the version of "e" you're working:
** For Debug versions of "e": Win32 Unicode Debug  (NOT the .DLL version)

== Configuration ==
* Create a system environmental variable named "WXWIN28" set to "C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7\"  (without quotes)
** Make sure it's a system variable, and not a personal one.


= Metakit =
Metakit is a lightweight embedded database.

Website: http://www.equi4.com/metakit/overview.html

== Installation ==
* The easiest way to get Metakit sources is to use Subversion.
* In e/external:
* svn export svn://www.equi4.com/metakit/trunk metakit

== Building ==
* Open "metakit\win\msvc60\mksrc.dsw" and allow the .sln to be upgraded for VS2008.
* Change the configuration to "Debug" (not Debug MFC or Debug STD, just plain "Debug")

The Python and Tcl bindings for Metakit will fail to build (unless you set them up);
that's OK as e doesn't use them. The distribution project will also fail after that,
but again, that's OK.


= PCRE =
PRCE is a library for Perl-compatible regular expressions.
e is currently using version 7.6.

Website: http://pcre.org/

PCRE can be compiled with Visual Studio by using CMake, a cross-platform configure/make tool.
CMake can be downloaded from: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

== CMake ==
* If you are not using the pre-configured .sln, you will need to download, install and run "CMake"
* Use the Windows installer from here: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

However, a pre-configured .sln is provided in: external/build_msvc/pcre

== Installation ==
* Get the 7.6 source package from either:
** http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10194&package_id=9960&release_id=572108
** ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/
* Unzip / decompress the download so you end up with external/pcre-7.6

== Patches ==
* Open a terminal to external
* patch -p0 < patches/pcre.patch

== Building ==
* If you are using CMake:
** Use CMake as described in pcre-7.6/NOT-UNIX-USE

* If you are using the pre-generated .sln:
** Copy the files from external/build_msvc/pcre to external/pcre-7.6

* Build the solution, Debug version.
* If you used CMake, you will need to copy certain build products the proper location.
* TO-DO ???


= libcurl =
cURL is a library for retrieving files from URLs.

Website: http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
Download Archive: http://curl.haxx.se/download/

== Installation ==
* Download the source archive for "curl-7.19.4.zip"
* Unzip / decompress the download and rename the folder so you end up with external/libcurl-7.19.4

== Building ==
* Copy "curllib.sln" & "curllib.vcproj" from external/build_msvc to external/libcurl-7.19.4/lib.
** (Or you can use the exsting "vc6curl.dsw" and let Visual Studio upgrade the project.)
* Build the Debug version of the "libcurl" project.
** If you build from an upgraded "vc6curl.dsw", curlsrc will probably fail but that's OK; e doesn't depend on it.
* Copy the built library from libcurl-7.19.4/lib/Debug/libcurd.lib to ??? where e expects it to be.

== To-Do ==
* There are some "missing" header files in the project that don't seem to break the build.
  These should probably be removed from the .sln.

= libtommath =
"LibTomMath provides highly optimized and portable routines for a vast 
majority of integer based number theoretic applications (including public 
key cryptography)."

LibTomMath is a dependency of LibTomCrypt.

== Installation ==
* Download 0.4.1 from: http://www.atarininja.org/~wxs/distfiles/ltm-0.41.tar.bz2
* Decompress the archive.
* Rename the folder "libtommath-0.41" to just "libtommath"
* Move the folder so you end up with externa/libtommath

== Building ==
* Copy "libtommath.sln" & "libtommath.vcproj" from external/build_msvc.
** (Or you can build using the exsting "libtommath.dsp", letting it be upgraded.)
** (If prompted, remove source control bindings.)
* Build the solution, Debug version.

= libtomcrypt =
"LibTomCrypt is a public domain open source cryptographic toolkit written in portable C."

Website: http://libtomcrypt.com/download.html
Mirror of version 1.17: http://www.atarininja.org/~wxs/distfiles/crypt-1.17.tar.bz2

== Installation ==
* Download version 1.17
* Unzip / decompress the download so you end up with external/libtomcrypt-1.17

== Building ==
* Copy "libtomcrypt.sln" & "libtomcrypt.vcproj" from external/build_msvc.
** (Or you can build using the exsting "libtomcrypt.dsp", letting it be upgraded.)
** (If prompted, remove source control bindings.)
* Verify that the correct folders are being used for extra "include" paths.
** Open the project properties.
** Verify the "Additional Include Directories" under "C/C++ | General"
** The libtommath path name should match the version of libtommath used above; it if doesn't
   then edit the path to have the correct verison.
** (Linking in libtommath is done in the e project, not this one, so we will verify the library
   path later.)
* Build the solution, Debug version.

== To-Do ==
* Fix incorrect linkage warnings in this project. (Build succeeds but with 740 warnigns!)

= TinyMXL =
"TinyXML is a simple, small, C++ XML parser that can be easily integrating into other programs."

Website: http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/

= Installation =
* Download the source archive from SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyxml
* Unzip / decompress the download so you end up with external/tinyxml

== Patching ==
* Copy the supplied patches for TinyXML into external/tinyxml
* Open a terminal to external/tinyxml and run:
** patch < tinyxml.cpp.patch
** patch < tinyxml.h.patch

= Building =
* Copy "tinyxml.sln" & "tinyxml_lib.vcproj" from external/build_msvc.
** (Or you can build using the existing .sln, letting it be upgraded to VS2008 format.)
* Open "tinyxml.sln" with Visual Studio 2008.
* Build the solution, Debug version.
